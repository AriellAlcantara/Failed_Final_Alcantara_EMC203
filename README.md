Solo attempt on the final project.
Features implemented:
1. Jumping(Slower fall)
2. Obstacles(Collisions, and generation)


Failed implementations:
1. Enemies failed to spawn for some reason
2. Spikes refused to show up(They were spawned but not visible) changing the matrices didn't seem to work
3. End goal, My obstacle feature made it impossible to reach the end due to the end goal going farther away as time passed, meaning it's a sisyphus experience instead.


Reason/s for failure:
1. New to mesh, I only learned mesh 2 weeks prior to the final exam.
2. Cramming, due to lack of time(on my part due to being busy) I cannot finish this project on time.
3. Relied on ChatGPT too much and trying to do it on my own was impossible, and ChatGPT(I didn't merely copy and paste) didn't make sense at times making it unusable.
